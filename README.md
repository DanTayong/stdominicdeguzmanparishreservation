# Abstract

The advancement of technology today is inevitably and regularly updating. New technologies such as home and business automation that uses wireless connections prove that everyday innovation is possible. Improvement of the current management and business processes using innovation and existing technologies is possible nowadays.

Founded in 1896 as part of the Manila Archdiocese, Saint Dominic de Guzman Parish, established in 1929 and became part of the San Jose Diocese in 1984 with 21,677 Catholics, is located at Real Street, Poblaci√≥n, Santo Domingo, Nueva Ecija. The incumbent Church's Parish Priest is Rev. Fr. Michael Grospe.

Currently, the current manual reservation hinders their progress into being more successful since manual registration and management is a waste of time and money. It also does not provide better security to record books and bulletins. They manually search for information whenever needed. Using the proposed system, the transaction between parish staff and customers will be more comfortable and efficient.

With this predicament, the proponents proposed a web-based reservation system that will improve the organization's work efficiency by automating routine and time-consuming tasks such as the time spent taking down customer's information. As a result, staff may use their time in other important tasks like preparing events. The local web-based reservation system will help eliminate the need to repeatedly encode lengthy information of the customer by having a secure, accessible, and organized electronic file storage.

The developers will use the Agile Software Development Life Cycle method for creating the proposed system since it focuses on process adaptability and customer satisfaction by rapidly delivering working software products.

The proponents successfully research the St. Dominic Parish. The system is titled Web-based Reservation and Record-Keeping System with QR code and SMS notification for St. Dominic Parish. The system provided a more comfortable and faster process for the customer and parish staff to handle reservations of events and manage information.
The parish staff who will manage the system will quickly understand its functionalities through the different modules since the developers made it simple and easy to understand. The system helps with the increase in their profit, improves performance, and reduces time and money. 

The developers also recommend that the proposed system have a mobile application to have easy contact with the parish office and request reservation of events aside from the website.
